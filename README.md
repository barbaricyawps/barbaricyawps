### Hello! I'm Alyssa Rock! 👋

I am a senior technical writer who is passionate about improving documentation in open source and designing community doc events that get people excited to contribute to docs.

🐙 I'm the chair of the [Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/), an open source community of software engineers and technical writers devoted to creating templates, tools, and resources for documentation in open source.

📢 I run the [Write the Docs Quorum program](https://github.com/write-the-docs-quorum/quorum-meetups), which provides quarterly online educational events for a community of passionate documentarians who want to learn and improve their craft.

📯 I work for VMware as a technical writer where I often contribute to the [Salt Project](https://github.com/saltstack/salt), a top 50 open source project.

☕ Check out my [portfolio site](https://alyssarock.pro/)!

:question: What does my GitHub handle mean, you ask? It's a quotation from Walt Whitman's [Song of Myself, 52](https://poets.org/poem/song-myself-52): "I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable, / I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world." Not only does it blend my interest in literature, but it's also a nod to my other passion of film. See Peter Weir's [Dead Poet's Society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6xyHna-NuM&ab_channel=PiecesOfStories) (1989).
