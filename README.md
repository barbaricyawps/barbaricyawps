### Hello! I'm Alyssa Rock! 👋

I am a senior technical writer who is passionate about improving documentation in open source and designing community doc events that get people excited to contribute to docs.

🐙 I'm the chair of the [Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/), an open source community of software engineers and technical writers devoted to creating templates, tools, and resources for documentation in open source.

📢 I run the Write the Docs Quorum program, which provides quarterly online educational events for a community of passionate documentarians who want to learn and improve their craft.

📯 I work for VMware as a technical writer where I often contribute to the open source project Salt.
